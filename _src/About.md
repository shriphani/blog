I am a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Jamie Callan.
I was an undergraduate in CS at Purdue University and have completed internships at Microsoft and Yelp.

I work primarily in information retrieval. I am currently building the ClueWeb12++ dataset. You can track our progress [here](http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/spalakod/posts/).
