# Personal

The focus of all technical writing on this website is to build an
easy-to-follow corpus of notes and documents. I primarily write about
machine-learning and clojure. Most blog posts tend to combine two or
more seminal works and explore common themes.

I am drawn to quirky choices. In December 2014, I embarked on a 51 hour
train trip from Pittsburgh, PA to San Francisco, CA on the California
Zephyr.

I wholeheartedly recommend traveling across the country by train.

I also hiked the Joshua Tree National Park in a white dress shirt.

I do not recommend this.
