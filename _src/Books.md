These are the books, papers, video lectures (some unrelated to my research) I've recently read and found interesting:

* Engineering
	* [how I write modules](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules) - Advice from James Halliday I've internalized.

* On this blog:
  * [A New Weapon In The Fight Against Syphilis](http://blog.shriphani.com/2015/07/21/a-new-weapon-in-the-fight-against-syphilis/)
  * [A Smallest Eigenvalues Of A Graph Laplacian](http://blog.shriphani.com/2015/04/06/the-smallest-eigenvalues-of-a-graph-laplacian/)
