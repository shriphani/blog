These are the books, papers, video lectures (some unrelated to my research) I've recently read and found interesting:

* Machine Learning:
    * [EM Tutorial](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring04/cps196.1/handouts/EM/tomasiEM.pdf) - Carlo Tomasi [mirror](/docs/em_tutorial.pdf)
        * I prefer this tutorial to others since it is comprehensive, leaves few details to the reader and avoids the "hidden-data" misnomer. The value of EM is explained via a simple MLE procedure. Reading the Rabiner paper after this was a breeze.
