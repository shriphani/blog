I have often Googled for symptoms, visited WebMD (and concluded that I have
a deadly disease). At SIGIR 2013, Ryen White's paper, [Beliefs and
Biases in IR](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ryenw/papers/WhiteSIGIR2013.pdf), provided empirical evidence for the poor success-rate of
diagnosis-by-google.

The authors mined medical yes/no questions (For example: Can salmonella
cause belly-ache), had physicians answer these questions, and then
measured user bias post-search (i.e. the users after perusing the
results answer their original questions with yes/no) (the paper
contains a very detailed description of the experiments conducted).

The accuracy of the final answer was the most interesting part of this
paper - __only about half of the questions were accurately answered.
That is as good as flipping a (fair) coin for each question__. The rest
of the paper was a fairly interesting read (and it won the SIGIR 2013
best paper award).
