I came across this test recently. If you need to discover a Russian under-cover agent
you can show them color words (words like red, green, blue) colored in a different color.

Like so:

<span style="color:blue">Green</span> <span style="color:yellow">Blue</span> <span style="color:red">Purple</span> 

If you comprehend the words, you perform poorly at this test than otherwise.
