I recently did an interview with India's 2nd largest newspaper - [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/society/shriphani-palakodety-indiaviz-2019-instagram-data-visualisations-and-india-maps/article30347624.ece) - about my cartography work with
the instagram account [@indiaviz](https://instagram.com/indiaviz).

Do read it and let me know what you feel. I am also soliciting ideas for collaborations and that sort of thing.
