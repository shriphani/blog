I first encountered the story of Phineas Gage in my freshman year in
college. Phineas had a projectile drill a hole in his head (while he
worked the railroad) and he survived the incident. The incident caused
a massive personality change in Phineas and conclusively ruled out
[phrenology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) as a reasonable
model of how the brain worked.

After the incident Phineas' life comprised a trip to South America, a
gig at P.T. Barnum's establishment and a massive change in our
understanding of the brain. This
[wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage) covers
a good chunk of this work.
