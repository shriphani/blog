Singapore's government (and Mentos was involved in this awkward project) used [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jxU89x78ac)
on their National Day celebrations to encourage people to copulate and
increase Singapore's birth rate. I hypothesized that a low fertility
rate (number of children per woman) was not unique to Singapore (though the problem might be more
acute in Singapore).

Here's a plot of GDP vs. fertility rates for all nations. The red dots
are the devloped countries:

Clearly the poorest nations have a ridiculously high fertility rate.
The red dots represent the developed economies - almost all of which
lie below the [replacement fertility rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility) of 2.1

Here's a plot of just the developed economies:

And a similar plot for developed Asian economies:
