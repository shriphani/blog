After my [recent bookstand project](/2017/07/23/bookstand/), I was looking for a
simple project to put left-over lumber to good use. These coasters are what I came
up with.

 <div class="nav3">

	<img src="/img/coasters3.jpg" class="iconsr" />
 </div>
 <img src="/img/coasters4.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 30px;" class="nav4" />

A tree is the epitome of a selfless life - it provides shelter and sustenance for
decades and it is sad to see any part of such a worthy being go to waste.

In this post I describe a quick project combining cedar, purpleheart and maple.
The combination is aesthetically pleasing and can be put together in a few hours
with simple hand tools.

I was building this project on a tight schedule and thus things don't line up
100% - someone with better skills or more time should produce better output.

Rounded corners are obtained by a simple principle we learn in math. Lots
of straight cuts along the tangents of the desired circle, form the cicle.

I marked out the desired corner trajectory using a pair of divider calipers
and filed away enough material until I obtained this result:

Then I glued my maple and purpleheart blocks like so:

Using a drill press I put in a few holes for birch dowels. The result was:

 <div class="nav3">
	<img src="/img/coasters9.jpg" class="iconsl" />
	<img src="/img/coasters10.jpg" class="iconsr" />
 </div>

Finally I inserted the dowels with glue around them to fix them in place.

Someone mentioned compressed birch dowels to me that expand when glue is added.
These I trust are going to produce much stronger structures than what I have.

Finally, I applied wipe-on poly - I have developed a strong affection for this
product - incredible ease of use and very good results with minimal effort - a
winner.

Here are a couple of additional pictures of the coasters in their new home.
