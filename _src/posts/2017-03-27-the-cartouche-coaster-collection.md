In 1799, the Rosetta Stone was discovered and it set off an arms race of sorts
between reigning superpowers Britain and France. The British scientific legend
Thomas Young who through the Double-Slit experiment demonstrated the wave theory
of light, studied elasticity and gave us the Young's modulus, studied capillary action
and so on. Young and the French scholar Champollion raced to decipher the text on the rosetta
stone. Young got pretty far with the demotic script but made scant progress with
the hieroglyphic script. His hypotheses were solid, but his skillset was insufficient.

Jean Francois Champollion ran with these ideas however and delivered.
Cartouches played a fundamental role in deciphering the hieroglyph script.
Inscriptions on obelisks and other artifacts led Egyptologists to understand
that cartouches contained the names of rulers. On lining up the names Ptolemy, Cleopatra
and so on between the Greek and the heiroglyph versions of the text on the rosetta stone, the whole
script sort-of unraveled itself and after a brief hiatus of a few millennia, ancient Egypt's
story was heard again.

The story of ancient Egypt is one of immense time-scales. The cartouche of Menes was drawn
2000 years after his death at Abydos - a time comparable to Jesus Christ and the modern day. From Menes
to Cleopatra, we can easily count 3000 years of human history. Sneferu's first showed the Egyptians
how to build pyramids and from his time to Cleopatra, more years have passed than from Cleopatra's
time to the present day.

We are very much the same species as the ancient Egyptians - driven by much of the same dreams
and needs. They gave us the pyramids, showed us how to marshall a large empire and harness
human capital on an immense scale.

What will our civilization leave behind?
