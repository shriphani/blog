For over five centuries the Sistine Chapel ceiling has been among the
greatest things man has produced. I would give two limbs for a magnum
opus of its caliber.

In contrast, the first time I saw a Rothko in my early teens, I
concluded that this was the outcome of giving a child with severe OCD
a set of crayons.

Over the last few weeks, amidst a very tough and frustrating period
(this is far too complex for this one post) in my life, I had a chance
to reflect on one of Rothko's signature pieces and study the
underlying process through a MOMA video [1]. I felt a new sense of respect
for Rothko's works. A Rothko is quite literally a metaphor for life.
Our visible exterior is the product of several layers that comprise
our experiences.

Rothko had a famous quote:

> The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious
> experience I had when I painted them.

It took eight years for me to have this experience. I am better off
for it.
