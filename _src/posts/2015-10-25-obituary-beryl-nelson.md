I first met Beryl Nelson in high school. Our first discussion covered lisp,
math, biology and her insights on education. Beryl was instrumental in my
decision to study CS and mathematics in college.

Over the years, Beryl's immense contributions to CS and CS outreach have
had massive impact on hundreds of people directly (and several millions through her work at Google).
She led teams in the early
years at Google Hyderabad, spoke at several ACM Grace Hopper events and did
amazing work steering hundreds of high-schoolers like me towards productive
careers in computing.
