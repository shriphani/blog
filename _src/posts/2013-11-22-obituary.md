Earlier this month, my paternal grandfather passed away. I didn't
speak to him before his death since I expected him to recover from his
current bout of ill-health and I have since carried some guilt thanks
to this.

I think this excerpt from a Pink Floyd song best summarizes his life:

> Run, run rabbit run<br />
> Dig that hole, forget the sun<br />
> And when at last the work is done<br />
> Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one<br />

<p style="text-align: right;">-- [Breathe, Pink Floyd](http://rock.rapgenius.com/Pink-floyd-breathe-lyrics)</p>

RIP.
