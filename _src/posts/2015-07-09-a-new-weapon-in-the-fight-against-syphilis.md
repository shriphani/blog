The American war effort in WW2 was characterized by one of the largest compulsory
drafts in history. A staggering 50 million men were registered and nearly 10 million
inducted.

There was just one problem. Circa 1940, we didn't know how to mass-produce penicilin and
contraceptives weren't considered an important public health tool. Syphilis, which was called The Great
Imitator (owing to the wide variety of symptoms that it came with), claimed 6 out of
every 100,000 deaths.  -- some other quote to sound smart here.

These conditions meant that every inductee had to be subjected to a blood test - a
brutal exercise in logistics for a rapidly expanding military.

Robert Dorfman, a Harvard economist, produced an elegant process to cut down
on the number of blood tests needed and in the process produced a seminal paper
in the field of group testing.

In this post, we'll derive the results from that paper - which as you'll observe
boils down to simple algebra.

Then, I'll describe how group-testing is leveraged (quite heavily) in modern computer
science by cryptographers.
