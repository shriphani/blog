Last week, I dropped out of the PhD program at LTI, SCS, Carnegie Mellon University with a masters degree. The specifics
of this decision will remain private. If you are going through issues in your PhD program, I will
be happy to talk to you and give you advice (should you desire any). You can email me at: <a href="mailto:shriphanip@gmail.com">shriphanip@gmail.com</a>. You can also call me at 425-623-2604.
