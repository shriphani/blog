I want to share a couple more woodworking projects.

The first is a jatoba spatula, the second a bloodwood cutting board.

Jatoba is a stunning wood - after sanding down to 1500 grit, when you
run your finger on the surface, it has this velvety, posh, expensive
feel.

It feels gorgeous to look at, it is amazing to touch.

The bloodwood board was rescued from a scrap bin and cleaned up.

Removing the dirt and grime revealed a surface full of character
and vibrant colors. The contrast between the live edge and the grain,
the reds, the blacks and the yellows - this is a masterpiece forged
by nature - one no man can produce.
