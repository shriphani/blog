I found this recent paper on adhoc-IR from CIKM 2013. I haven't worked
in this area but the results seem promising. Essentially, instead of
TF, you store an indegree count. The graph in question is the term
co-occurrence graph within a window with the direction indicating
word-order. The paper won hon. mention at the CIKM so it is clearly
very cool.
