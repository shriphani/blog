Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.

"But which is the stone that supports the bridge", Kublai Khan asks.

"The bridge is not supported by one stone or another", Marco answers, but
by the line of the arch they form.

Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting, then he adds, "Why do you speak of the
stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."

Polo answers, "Without stones there is no arch."
