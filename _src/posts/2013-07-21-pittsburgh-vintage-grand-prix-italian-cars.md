In the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix [<a name="pvgp-back" href="#pvgp">1</a>], Ferrari had a large exhibit in celebration of their 50th year in America and a few Lamborghinis, Alfas and Maseratis showed up. Since I am not likely to ever own a Ferrari, I behaved like a tourist and took a few pictures. Some of these vehicles were incredibly well maintained.
