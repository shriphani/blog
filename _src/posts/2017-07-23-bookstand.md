I finally put together my first complex woodworking project
with moving parts. The result looks gorgeous to me - I have rarely
seen 3 woods with such different textures complement each other
so well.

My typical process for most projects is to start out, run through
the steps mentally and then fill in the details as needed.

##Trays

The core components that don't depend on each other are obviously
the trays where the book sits, the hinge mechanism that allows you
to open and close the object.

I had 2 cedar planks - 36"x6"x0.75" each. These had to be reshaped
to form the two trays. The easiest way is to cut them up, glue them,
sand until you get a smooth seamless join and then trim the edges
so they all line up:

The next step is to breadcrumb the whole thing. I used purpleheart - a gorgeous
exotic wood that is naturally purple.

Breadcrumbs are built using a similar process as the original boards - glue and then
sand down.

I drew an abstract peacock and then laser-etched it onto the boards.

##Hinge Stand

I decided to go with a blind hinge - i.e. you don't see bits of the dowel
(rod) sticking out. One half of the hinge-stand looks like this:

The other half looks like this:

<img src="/img/hinge2.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;" />

The only other bits involved were putting the maple bits in and gluing
everything together.

And it all came together for a gorgeous piece of furniture to put a nice
book on.
