    Title: A More Perfect Society

My Uber driver a few weeks ago was a refugee from Afghanistan.

When he first arrived here, he spoke no English. He had no family and
friends.

Uber was the first job he held. Conversing with dozens of passengers every
day was vital in picking up English.

When I met him, he had spent a year in the Bay Area. His command of English
was solid and he was considering going to community college.

I am extremely proud of the fact that this new economy allows a person with
no connections or language skills - incredible barriers to success - to actually
move up in life.

This is the definition of a successful society - one where everyone has a shot
at a good life. And one where forces beyond your control don't get in the way
of your success.
